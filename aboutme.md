Thank you for taking out time to know more about me:

I‚Äôm Jitendra Jangid. I‚Äôm native to Degana (Nagaur, Rajasthan). I've completed my B.Tech in Civil Engineering from **IIT Kharagpur** (2018) üë®‚Äçüéì and currently I am a Data Scientist @ **ZS Associates Gurgaon** üíª

I am a self-motivated, and a disciplined soul. I am always keen to up-skill myself by learning new things whenever I get a chance.

My real strength is my attention to detail. I pride myself on my reputation for following through and meeting deadlines. When I commit to doing something, I make sure it gets done, and on time. I have gained analyzing the situations, planning strategy, learning about resources, making decisions, coordinating and motivating the team to lead it to success.

Over the past couple of years, I have worked on some of the toughest problems in biomedical NLP and predictive data science at ZS Associates. Due to the highly challenging and ever-evolving field of data science, I have always loved doing more and more of it.

ZS Work Experience:

- Built a fully automated & end to end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that leverages state of the art models (BERT) & transfer learning to classify text and extract explicit/implicit information using syntactic and semantic relationships from protocol documents (PDFs) to make recommendations on optimizing the clinical trial design. Reduced manual effort by 50-60% for protocol designing process and accelerated clinical programs through more efficient trial designs.
- Developed an end to end product that combines entity recognition & linking, and weakly supervised learning with deep neural networks to classify unstructured biomedical text from open-source data (ClinicalTrials.Gov, PubMed) to expedite the clinical program planning and trial
design process. Reduced time, effort & cost for clinical trial designing (weeks to hours) and automated insights to better inform future clinical trial investment.

I was involved with many data science applications in IIT Kharagpur during my tenure which has led me to participate in several online and offline national and international competitions in data science and secure decent rankings also.

I wrote 2 research papers in this field (On machine learning) during my graduation period, presented all of these in the international conferences and got it published in proceedings of all the conference and journal too.

I have acquired many of the skills needed to hold this position such as having the ability to research and understand statistical data.

I also have the ability to do in-depth research to look for current trends in a variety of fields. I have strong Data Science skills that include knowledge of Machine Learning (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), NLP, Deep Learning (Keras, TensorFlow), Probability and Statistics, Statistical language R and Python.
